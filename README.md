GauchoJS
===========================================

Gaucho is simply some Nodejs scripts to access the
[Rancher 1.x](https://github.com/rancher/rancher)'s API to perform tasks which
I need to have executed through my deployment workflow.

At this point, it does not contain much but it might grow as I get more
requirements.

Contributions are welcome if you want to use it and add to it.

## Usage

Gaucho can be run directly on a command line provided you have Nodejs installed.

```
npm install -g rancher-gaucho
``` 

It can also be run as a Docker container:

```
docker run --rm -it mheiniger/gaucho query 1s245
```

### Rancher Host, Access Key and Secret

Gaucho needs to know the Rancher host and must be given an access key and access
secret to be able to interact with the Rancher's API. This can be done through
environment variables:

   - `CATTLE_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `CATTLE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `CATTLE_URL`

#### SSL Validation

If you want to turn off SSL validation because you are using a self-signed certificate
or a private CA-signed certificate, you can pass the environment variable:

    - `SSL_VERIFY=false`

You can also mount the SSL certificate chain into the container, and pass the path to the
certificate as an environment variable:

   - `-v /path/to/ca_chain.crt:/root/ca.crt`
   - `-e SSL_VERIFY=/root/ca.crt`

#### Rancher Agent Container

If you run Gaucho in a container on Rancher, rather than set the environment
variables manually, use the following labels to have Rancher automatically do it
for you.

```
io.rancher.container.create_agent=true
io.rancher.container.agent.role=environment
```

See [Service Accounts in Rancher](http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/latest/en/rancher-services/service-accounts/)
for more information on this feature.
